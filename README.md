## Model Details

The application uses TensorFlow's pre-trained **PoseNet model** for pose detection. The key features of this model include:

- **Keypoint Detection:** Identifies major joints such as elbows, knees, and shoulders.
- **Skeletal Visualization:** Draws connections between keypoints to create a skeletal representation.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Runs efficiently on both CPU and GPU.
- **Scalability:** Can be extended to multiple people detection in a single frame.

## App Interface

The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly:

### Pose Analysis Settings
- **Confidence Threshold:** Adjustable slider to control the accuracy of detected poses.
- **Analysis Mode:** Dropdown menu to toggle between:
  - Basic Pose Detection
  - Advanced Analysis (e.g., angles, postural evaluation).

### Upload Section
- Drag and drop your file (images: PNG, JPG, JPEG) into the designated area.
- A clear set of instructions is displayed to guide users:
  1. Click the "Browse Files" button.
  2. Select an appropriate file for analysis.
  3. Ensure the file is clear and high-quality for best results.
